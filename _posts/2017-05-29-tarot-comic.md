This memorial weekend my family and friends visited Seeley Lake. We told many stories and laughed about the silliness of ackward circumstances. In the midst of our relating my new friend Sam red my tarrot and the results were quite positive!

I also watched a fabulous horror movie called [Get Out!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Out_(film))
